1.Windows :  Virtualization: Enabled
2.
Three Pros:
-Cost-Effective: Eliminates the need for large upfront investments in hardware and reduces operational costs.

-Scalability & Elasticity: Resources can be scaled up or down instantly to meet demand.

-Accessibility: Services can be accessed from anywhere with an internet connection.

Three Cons:
-Security & Privacy Concerns: Entrusting sensitive data to a third-party provider carries inherent risks.

-Dependency & Vendor Lock-in: Migrating from one cloud provider to another can be difficult and costly.

-Requires Internet Connectivity: A stable internet connection is necessary to access cloud services.
3.primary function of hypervisor is to create and manage virtual machines
4.A virtual machine (VM) is a software-based emulation of a physical computer. It runs a complete operating system and applications, just like a real computer, but it exists as a set of files on a physical "host" machine. Essentially, it's a computer within a computer. 
5.
The key benefits of using virtual machines include:
-Resource Consolidation: Run multiple operating systems and applications on a single physical server, improving hardware utilization.

-Isolation: VMs are isolated from each other and the host system, enhancing security and stability.

-Portability: VMs can be easily moved or copied between different physical hosts.

-Cost Savings: Reduces the need for physical hardware, lowering power and cooling costs.

-Efficient Testing & Development: Provides sandboxed environments for testing software without affecting the host system.

6.
Use Cases of Virtual Machines:
-Server Consolidation: Combining multiple physical servers into fewer machines to save costs.

-Software Testing & Development: Creating isolated "sandboxes" to test new applications or updates.

-Running Legacy Applications: Using an older OS in a VM to run applications that aren't compatible with modern systems.

-Disaster Recovery: Creating snapshots and clones of systems for quick restoration after a failure.

-Cloud Computing: Cloud providers use VMs to offer scalable infrastructure (IaaS) to their customers.

10.The purpose of cloning a virtual machine is to create an exact duplicate of an existing VM. This is extremely useful for quickly deploying multiple, identical VMs (e.g., for a web server farm) or for creating a copy of a production environment for testing purposes without affecting the live system.
